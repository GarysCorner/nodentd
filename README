Setup
+++++++++++++++++++

To setup nodentd, simple copy the contents of config.sample.js to config.js.  Then use your favorite text editor to modified the contents of config.js to suit your needs.  Pay special attention to the comments.

Configuration is done by exporting a JSON object so make sure your formating is correct.  DO NO EXCEPT CONFIG FILES FROM PEOPLE YOU DO NOT KNOW, config files are run just like any other part of the program and malicious users can insert code.

The name providers are called in the order listed in the nameprovders array.  If a nameprovider returns false (no name) then the next provider is used.  Keep in mind that some providers like the "random_fromlist" provider and the "defaultname" provider always return a valid username and so no nameproviders placed after them in the stack will ever be called.

To test your config file you may want to setup "debug" to true, which will produce more output.

Running
+++++++++++++++++++

To start nodentd simply run "run.js" using node.js, if you are using nodentd in production you should write a script that starts nodentd again if it crashes because an unknown error bubbles up.
